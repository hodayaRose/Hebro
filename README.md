## Project Overview

The "Hebro" app represents a cutting-edge educational platform, meticulously engineered to offer children an engaging and interactive journey into the Hebrew language. Developed using SwiftUI, the app showcases a seamless, modern interface tailored to enhance the learning experience through two distinct game-based methodologies.

### Technical Frameworks and Functionalities:

#### Augmented Reality Game:
- Utilizes ARKit and RealityKit to immerse users in an augmented reality environment.
- Features a lifelike usdz model that, upon interaction, triggers a synthetic voice from AVFoundation, articulating the Hebrew word to reinforce learning.

#### Coloring Game:
- Built with the PencilKit framework, it offers a digital canvas for artistic expression, complementing language learning with creative coloring activities.

#### Course Shop View:
- Integrates a smooth-scrolling interface for course exploration.
- Employs in-app purchases and PassKit for a seamless transaction experience.
- Leverages Contentful API for dynamic content delivery, ensuring a rich and up-to-date educational curriculum.

### User Management:
- Incorporates Google Firestore for robust user login functionality and data management.

### Additional Enhancements:
- Implements Lottie and SDWebImageSwift for an enriched visual narrative and efficient image handling.

### Quality Assurance:
- Adopts a vigilant testing regime backed by an Alert Manager to oversee error handling, guaranteeing a reliable user experience.

### Design Architecture:
- The app is structured around the MVVM design pattern, promoting clean code, efficient data handling, and improved maintainability.

### Professional Acumen:
The development of "Hebro" stands as a testament to my comprehensive capabilities as a software engineer. With an eye for detail and a passion for creating educational solutions, I have harnessed the full potential of advanced frameworks to construct an application that is not only technologically sophisticated but also pedagogically sound. This project underscores my commitment to delivering quality, innovative software that enriches the educational landscape.
